# ODA Component accelerator source code

This repo contains the source code (and dockerfiles) for the controllers that form part of the ODA Canvas, and the custom resource definitions that provide the data model for the intent-based interfaces to the controllers.

The controller docker images are used in the Helm charts in the [tmforum-oda/oda-canvas-charts](https://github.com/tmforum-oda/oda-canvas-charts) repository.
